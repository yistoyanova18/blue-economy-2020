                Economy� is an emerging concept which encourages better stewardship of our ocean or �blue� resources. It underpins the thinking behind the Commonwealth Blue Charter, highlighting in particular the close linkages between the ocean, climate change, and the wellbeing of the people of the Commonwealth. At its heart, it reaffirms the values of the Commonwealth, including equity and public participation in marine and coastal decision-making.  It supports all of the United Nations� Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), especially SDG14 �life below water�, and recognises that this will require ambitious, co-ordinated actions to sustainably manage, protect and preserve our ocean now, for the sake of present and future generations.

                The blue economy goes beyond viewing the ocean economy solely as a mechanism for economic growth. In the �business-as-usual� model, large-scale industrial nations have seen the development of their ocean economies through the exploitation of maritime and marine resources � for example through shipping, commercial fishing, and the oil, gas, minerals and mining industries - often without a view to the effects their activities have on the future health or productivity of those same resources.
